# Overview
RDTScan is an open-source library for developers who are interested in creating Android apps that support the digital curation and interpretation of [rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_diagnostic_test). RDTScan provides the following functionality:

**1. Real-Time Quality Checking During Image Capture**
checks image quality using image processing and provides real-time feedback to end-users so they can capture the clearest image possible of their RDT. 

**2. Robust Result Interpretation**
Assuming a satisfactory image has been captured, RDTScan can post-process the image to emphasize any faint lines that may appear on the immunoassay. The end-user can view that image for themselves to make an informed decision about their test results. Alternatively, RDTScan provides an algorithm that interprets the test results on the end-user's behalf.

RDTScan is designed to work with 

**Disclaimer:** Please note that the app has not yet been clinically validated.
