# Overview
RDTScan is an open-source library for developers who are interested in developing Android apps for capturing and interpreting images of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). RDTScan checks image quality using image processing and provides real-time feedback to end-users so they can capture the clearest image possible of their RDT. 
* Interpretation can be done by providing enhanced image
* or by reading the lines themselves

This work is financial supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Please note that the app has not yet been clinically validated.
