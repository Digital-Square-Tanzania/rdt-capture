# Overview
RDTScan is an open-source library for developers who are interested in creating Android apps that support the digital curation and interpretation of [rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_diagnostic_test). RDTScan provides the following functionality:

**1. Real-Time Quality Checking During Image Capture**  
RDTScan uses image processing to check the quality of images intercepted from the smartphone's camera while the user moves their smartphone over the RDT. RDTScan provides functions for checking the blurriness and lighitng of incoming camera frames. If the RDT is detected within the image, RDTScan, also checks the scale and orientation of the RDT in the image. To help end-users capture the clearest image possible, RDTScan intelligently generates instructions based on these quality checks.

**2. Robust Result Interpretation**  
Assuming a satisfactory image has been captured, RDTScan can post-process the image to emphasize any faint lines that may appear on the immunoassay. The end-user can view that image for themselves to make an informed decision about their test results. Alternatively, RDTScan provides an algorithm that interprets the test results on the end-user's behalf.

RDTScan uses a SIFT feature-based template-matching approach for RDT recognition. This means that unlike model-driven approaches that require a dataset of example images for model training, RDTScan only requires a single example image and some metadata about the test itself (e.g., relative position and meaning of each line). Although RDTScan is designed to be as generalizable as possible, its template-matching approach is less amenable to the following RDT characteristics:
* Blank cassettes with little or no lettering
* Inconsistent patterns (e.g., QR code, bar code)

**Disclaimer:** Although RDTScan has been tested through multiple in-lab studies and real-world deployments, this library has not been FDA-approved.

# Installation
RDTScan utilizes [OpenCV for Android](https://opencv.org/android/) for many of the image processing steps, which in turn relies on [Android's Native Development Kit (NDK)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/). Setting up these resources can be difficult for some developers, so there are two options for getting started with RDTScan:
* **No existing project:** If you are making a smartphone app from scratch, you can simply clone the repository directly and build your app on top of what has already been provided. This repository has all of the resources properly configured along with a fully-functioning user interface.
* **Existing project:** If you have a smartphone app that has already been made and you are looking to add RDTScan to it, you will still need to add OpenCV for Android to your project. The [official tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/O4A_SDK.html) for doing this is fairly outdated, but there are plenty of other tutorials out there depending on your environment. Once you have done that, copy `RDT.java`, `ImageProcessor.java`, and `RDTCameraView.java` over to your project.

## Troubleshooting:
* **Unable to locate NDK installation** If you have not already installed NDK, follow the instructions at this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk) to do so. Once that is done, NDK should be installed at a path that either looks like `C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Android/ndk/xx.x.xxxxxxx` (Windows) or `/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/xx.x.xxxxxxx` (OSX). Refering to this filepath as `NDK_HOME` There are two ways to point your project to this filepath: 
  1. Go to **File > Project Structure > SDK Location** and then set the path variable in **Android NDK Location** to `NDK_HOME`.
  2. Open the `local.properties` file and add the following line: `ndk.dir=NDK_HOME`
